12 hr = 360deg
1 hr = 360/12 = 30 deg
h hrs = 30h + m/2
 where 
 in 60 min = 30 deg : 1 hr = 30 deg
 1 min = 30/60 = 1/2
 m min = 1/2 m

 now 60min = 360 deg 
 1min = 360.60 = 6deg
 m min = 6m

 now 60 sec = 360sec 
 1 sec = 360/60 = 6deg
 s sec = 6s

 // 
 in java script 
 access the elements by id 
 get date 
let date = new Date();
then from date get hr store it in variable h
then from date get min store it in variable m
then from date get sec store it in variable s

rotate the angle 
hrotate = 30h+m/2
mrotate = 6*m
srotate = 6*s
by using style style the angle of rotation of the clock
